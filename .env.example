# OpenBao / OpenTofu vault provider token
# - Persistent mode: set automatically by ./init/init-openbao.sh
# - Dev mode: sets the initial root token via BAO_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID
# Used by docker-compose.yaml, OpenTofu vault provider, and host-side API calls.
# Note: BAO_TOKEN was replaced by VAULT_TOKEN for OpenTofu vault provider compatibility.
VAULT_TOKEN=root-token

# OpenBao server address (for host-side usage; inside Docker this is overridden)
VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200

# OpenBao image override (optional)
# To use a UI-enabled image built from third-party/openbao-ui/Dockerfile:
#   docker build -f third-party/openbao-ui/Dockerfile -t openbao:dev-ui .
# Then uncomment the line below:
# OPENBAO_IMAGE=openbao:dev-ui
